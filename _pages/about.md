Hello, my name is Tianzhou (Charles) Ma, I am an Assistant Professor in Biostatistics at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics of the School of Public Health at University of Maryland College Park. I received my PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Pittsburgh in 2018 and a MS in Biostatistics from Yale University in 2013. My research focuses on statistical methods in genomics and bioinformatics, meta-analysis and data integration, statistical machine learning, Bayesian analysis, high-dimensional variable selection, as well as their application in cancer, psychiatry and epidemiology fields. In addition to research, I like writing, playing soccer and basketball in my spare time.

Research interest
======
My research interest lies in the intersection between statistical methodology and its applications to multi-omics (e.g. genotyping, gene expression, epigenomics, proteomics, etc.) and bioinformatics. In particular, I am interested in omics data integration and meta-analysis, Bayesian modeling, high-dimensional variable selection, general statistical learning, and software development for general bioinformatic problems. In addition to methodology development, I have also collaborated with researchers in the cancer eld (e.g. breast cancer and ovarian cancer), psychiatry and epidemiology for data analysisand motivation of new methodology.
